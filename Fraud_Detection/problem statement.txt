Real-World Scenario: Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions
Problem Statement
You're tasked with developing a real-time fraud detection system for a financial institution. 
The system needs to process and analyze transaction data to identify suspicious activities that could indicate fraudulent behavior. 
The data includes historical transactions, customer profiles, and real-time streaming transaction data. 
The goal is to create a model that flags potential fraud in real-time, while also providing detailed analytics on customer behavior 
and transaction patterns.

Data Sources:

Historical Transactions: Stored in CSV format, containing past transaction data.
Customer Profiles: Stored in JSON format, containing demographic and financial information about customers.
Real-Time Streaming Transactions: Data in Parquet format, representing incoming transactions that need to be analyzed in real-time.

Tasks:

Data Ingestion:

Ingest historical transactions, customer profiles, and real-time streaming transactions.
Define complex schemas for each dataset explicitly.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handle missing values in customer profiles and historical transactions.
Normalize transaction amounts across different currencies.
Clean up any anomalies in the data, such as duplicate transactions.

Feature Engineering:

Create features such as transaction frequency, average transaction amount, and time of transaction.
Use window functions to create rolling averages and sums over time.
Apply User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to extract features from unstructured data (e.g., transaction descriptions).

Data Integration & Aggregation:

Join the historical transactions with customer profiles to enrich the data.
Aggregate transaction data at various levels (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify patterns.
Use different types of joins (inner, left, right, full outer) to explore relationships between datasets.

Real-Time Fraud Detection:

Implement a streaming data pipeline to process incoming transactions.
Apply a pre-trained machine learning model to flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
Use accumulators to count flagged transactions and other metrics.

Handling Data Skew & Optimization:

Identify and address data skew in historical transactions by repartitioning and coalescing.
Use broadcast joins and bucketing to optimize query performance.

Anomaly Detection & Reporting:

Identify anomalies using clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN).
Generate detailed reports and visualizations to highlight suspicious activities and patterns.

Saving & Storing Results:

Save flagged transactions and analysis results in a Delta table for further investigation.
Store aggregated metrics and reports in a Parquet format for efficient querying.
