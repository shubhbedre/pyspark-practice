Real-World Scenario: Multi-Source Data Integration and Analysis for a Financial Institution Problem Statement

You're working for a large financial institution that wants to integrate data from multiple sources to build a comprehensive customer profile. 

The data comes from three different sources:

Customer Transactions: A transactional database (SQL) that records all customer transactions. The data is in JSON format.
Credit Scores: A flat file (CSV) from a third-party credit score provider that provides credit scores and other related information.
Customer Feedback: Unstructured data from customer feedback collected via emails and social media, available in a combination of XML and free text.

The goal is to create a unified customer profile by combining these datasets, performing data cleaning, 
handling missing values, and then generating insights like customer segmentation, 
identifying high-risk customers, and predicting potential defaulters.

Data Sources:

Transactions Data: Stored in JSON format.
Credit Scores Data: Stored in CSV format.
Customer Feedback: Combination of XML and free text.

Tasks:

Data Ingestion:

Ingest data from all three sources.
Explicitly define complex schemas for each data source.

Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values:

Handle missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., mean imputation for numerical data, mode imputation for categorical data).
Normalize and clean text data from the feedback source.

Data Integration:

Join the datasets using different types of joins (inner, left, right, and full outer joins) based on customer ID.
Use broadcasting and accumulators to optimize joins and aggregations.

Data Aggregation & Transformation:

Use window functions to calculate rolling averages of transaction amounts, and rank customers based on transaction frequency.
Use UDFs (User-Defined Functions) to clean and process the free text in feedback.

Data Partitioning & Bucketing:

Repartition the data based on specific columns (e.g., customer ID).
Implement bucketing to optimize queries on large datasets.

Data Skew Handling:

Identify and handle data skew in the transaction data by using coalesce and repartitioning strategies.
Analytics & Predictions:

Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques (e.g., K-means).
Predict potential defaulters using logistic regression or decision trees.

Save the Final Data:

Save the final integrated and cleaned dataset in a Delta table.
