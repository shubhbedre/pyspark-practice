********************************* Problem Statement *********************************
You have a system logs dataset where each log represents an action taken by a user on a website. 
The company wants to extract the following insights:

1. User Action Sessionization: Break user activity into sessions where each session ends if the user is inactive for more than 30 minutes.
2. Top Active Users: Identify the top 10 users who performed the most actions in a day.
3. Session Activity Summary: For each user session, compute the following:
    - Total number of actions taken
    - Time spent in the session (i.e., difference between the first and last action in the session)
4. Time Distribution Analysis: Analyze the activity across different hours of the day, aggregating actions for each user in hourly windows.
5. Handle Data Skew: You should repartition the data based on user IDs to handle any data skew.
6. Identify Bot-Like Behavior: Use a UDF to flag sessions where the user performs more than 100 actions within 5 minutes.
